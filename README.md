## LiteBlue

Do you know what LiteBlue is? No? Then this will be useless to you.
It's just a basic WKWebView app that opens LiteBlue and nothing else. Has your forward, back, and reload buttons, can open all the employee apps.

UI layout might be a bit fucked on notched iPhones, I don't own any. It works great on my 7+

Enjoy?
